## Local Setup

To setup this project on your own machine, clone this repository and navigate into the working directory:

```bash
# clone github project
git clone https://github.com/jonathanguven/play-trend.git

# navigate into project directory
cd play-trend
```
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Once youre inside the project directory, install the project dependencies using:
```bash
# pnpm, npm, or yarn install
npm install
```
